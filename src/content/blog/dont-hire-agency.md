  There are moments when hiring a marketing agency is smart, and moments when it is basically setting money on fire with nicer typography. If you do not have an offer, a basic sales process, or any capacity to follow up on leads, no agency on earth is going to save you.

Agencies love listing all the reasons you should hire them. So here are the reasons you shouldn’t.

## **Do Not Hire Us If You Do Not Have an Offer**

If you cannot clearly say what you sell, to whom, and for how much, you are not ready for marketing. You are still in the “I have a vibe and a domain” phase.

## **Do Not Hire Us If Your Sales Process Is Chaos**

If your sales process is:

1. Someone reaches out  
2. You panic  
3. You forget to respond  

You do not need marketing. You need a functioning sales process.

## **Do Not Hire Us If You Want Magic Instead of Work**

If your goal is to “sprinkle SEO” or “go viral,” you are not looking for a partner. You are looking for a magician you can blame later.

## **Do Not Hire Us If You Hate Data**

If every decision is based on vibes instead of numbers, nothing we do will matter.

When you do have the offer, the process, and the willingness to change, then yes, bring in help. Until then, save your money.
