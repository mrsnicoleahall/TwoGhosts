excerpt: |
  I can’t stand the trend that hit the marketing industry right around the time the time the internet burst into the world. Marketers started seeing themselves as gurus and hoarders of knowledge. When we started caring more about clicks and CPAs then just being persuasive, we got lazy thinking we could shortcut the system.  Enter the ”SME.” I loathe the elitist subject matter expert. You are not the horcrux of business success, Mr. Subject Matter Expert.  Long live the marketing generalist!

Angry segue aside, I believe in sharing ALL of the knowledge. The AirTable below is my best attempt at scraping together bits of information to lay out all marketing plays by project, funnel applications, and create some type of classification system to determine if your team or agency can/will/should offer the services.  It was intended to be restricted to marketing, but there’s so much overlap between marketing and sales, the two are barely distinguishable from one another.
