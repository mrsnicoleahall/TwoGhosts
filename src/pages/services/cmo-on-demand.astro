          Strategic Marketing Leadership, Without the Full-Time Hire
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-xl text-gray-50">
          <p>
            Hiring a full-time CMO is expensive. And unless you're a certain size, probably overkill. But you still need someone who can think strategically, build systems, and hold your marketing team accountable.
          </p>
          <p>
            CMO-on-Demand gives you senior marketing leadership when you need it—without the salary, equity, or overhead of a full-time executive. Think of it as a fractional CMO who actually knows what they're doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We embed with your team, bring strategic clarity, build scalable systems, and make sure your marketing actually supports your business goals. Then we make sure it keeps working after we're gone.
