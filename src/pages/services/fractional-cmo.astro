            Senior Marketing Leadership Without the $250K Price Tag

            <p>
              Most companies can't afford a full-time CMO. And honestly, most don't need one. But they do need someone who thinks like a CMO—building strategy, aligning teams, making tough calls, and holding marketing accountable to revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's where we come in. We step into your business as a fractional CMO—bringing senior marketing leadership, strategic thinking, and hands-on execution without the full-time commitment or six-figure salary.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're not consultants who parachute in with a deck and disappear. We embed with your team, roll up our sleeves, and own the outcomes. We build the systems, make the decisions, and stick around long enough to make sure it all actually works.
