          <p>
            Campaigns fail for two reasons: bad strategy or bad execution. Usually both.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most campaigns are built backwards—starting with tactics instead of outcomes, channels instead of audiences, creative instead of message. They look good in a deck but fall apart in market.
          </p>
          <p>
            We build campaigns that work because we start with what matters: a clear goal, a specific audience, and a message that actually resonates. Then we build the tactics, creative, and channel mix to make it happen.
