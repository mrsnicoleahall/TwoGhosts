          Marketing That Actually Drives Revenue
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-xl text-gray-50">
          <p>
            Most marketing strategies are just glorified to-do lists. Post three times a week. Run some ads. Send an email newsletter. Hope something sticks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Real marketing strategy is about understanding your market, positioning your offer, and building systems that predictably generate revenue. It's about knowing exactly who you're talking to, what they care about, and how to reach them where they actually are.
          </p>
          <p>
            We don't do marketing theater. We build strategies that connect the dots between what you sell and who needs it—then show you exactly how to execute.
